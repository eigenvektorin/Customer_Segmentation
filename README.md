## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
This project employs Machine Learning algorithms to extract information about potential customers from German demographic data. As part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree, it demonstrates the primary steps to solving the underlying business needs: data comprehension, data preparation, modeling, and evaluation. The data and outline of this project was provided by Arvato Financial Solutions, a global provider of financial services, IT services, and supply chain management solutions to business customers.
The project's ultimate goal is to understand customer demographics in comparison to the general population in order to decide whether to approach a person for future products.
The project is divided in several subparts:  

Before the models are formed, the usual steps for data understanding and data cleaning are carried out.   
  
In **Part 1**, I used unsupervised learning techniques — namely PCA and Clustering with KMeans — to describe the relationship between the demographics of the company's existing customers and the general population of Germany.This way, I identified groups of the general population that are more likely to be part of the mail-order company's main customer base  (and which are not)  
  
In **Part 2**, a further dataset with demographic information for targets of a marketing campaign of the company is analysed. This dataset served as a training dataset for a supervised learning model in order to predict whether or not a given person is likely to become a customer.
